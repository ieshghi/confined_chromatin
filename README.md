# confined_chromatin

This repository contains the code used to numerically solve the equations of motion described in our paper on active chromatin flows in confinement: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02411

The current version of the code is not very user-friendly, it is shared as a matter of transparency. For a big-picture overview of the calculations it performs, see the appendix of the above paper.

If there is significant interest in using this code or part of it, I may clean it up and write actual documentation for its use.

This code uses the excellent package SHTNS (https://nschaeff.bitbucket.io/shtns/index.html) for two-dimensional Vector Spherical Harmonic transforms.
